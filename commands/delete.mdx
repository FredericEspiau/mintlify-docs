## Synopsis

```bash
pnpm start delete [ids...] [options]
```

Remove cards from the database by ID or delete all cards.

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--all` | boolean | Delete ALL cards (requires confirmation) |

## Examples

### Delete Specific Cards

```bash
# Delete a single card by ID
pnpm start delete a1b2c3d4

# Delete multiple cards
pnpm start delete a1b2c3d4 e5f6g7h8 i9j0k1l2
```

### Delete All Cards

```bash
# Delete entire database (prompts for confirmation)
pnpm start delete --all
```

## Finding Card IDs

Use the `list` command to find card IDs:

```bash
# List cards with their IDs
pnpm start list

# Output shows IDs:
# ID: a1b2c3d4  │ Front: Comment faire une julienne...
# ID: e5f6g7h8  │ Front: Quelle température pour...
```

## Confirmation Prompt

When deleting multiple cards or using `--all`:

```
⚠️  Delete 5 cards?

Cards to delete:
  a1b2c3d4 - Comment faire une julienne...
  e5f6g7h8 - Quelle température pour...
  ...

Type 'yes' to confirm: _
```

## ID Format

Card IDs are the first 8 characters of a SHA256 hash of the card content:

```
Full ID:  a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
Short ID: a1b2c3d4 (used in commands)
```

You can use either the full or short ID.

## Undo

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent. There is no undo.
</Warning>

Consider backing up before bulk deletions:

```bash
# Backup database
cp output/cards/cooking-cards.json output/cards/cooking-cards.backup.json

# Then delete
pnpm start delete --all

# Restore if needed
cp output/cards/cooking-cards.backup.json output/cards/cooking-cards.json
```

## Review Logs

When cards are deleted:
- The card entry is removed from `cards` object
- Associated review logs are **preserved** in `reviewLogs` array
- This maintains historical review statistics
