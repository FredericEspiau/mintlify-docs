## Interpreting Stats

<Tip>
**Healthy metrics:**
- Retention rate > 85%
- Average difficulty 3-6
- Balanced tag distribution
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Warning signs:**
- High % of Relearning cards → too many lapses
- Average difficulty > 7 → cards may be too hard
- Many New cards → review backlog forming
</Warning>

## Time-Based Analysis

The stats command calculates metrics based on:
- Card creation dates
- Review log history
- FSRS predictions

All data comes from `output/cards/cooking-cards.json`.
